NFSdb
======

NFSdb is a low latency, high throughput time-series database written entirely in Java. The goal of the project is a study of what's possible to do in java with large datasets. And I would like to share benefits of this study with everybody.

NFSdb requires minimum of Java 7 and you can get it from maven Central:

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.nfsdb</groupId>
            <artifactId>nfsdb-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.1</version>
        </dependency>

```

You can find usage example code in [nfsdb-samples] (https://github.com/bluestreak01/nfsdb/tree/master/nfsdb-samples) repository.

Alternatively there is quick start guide on github [wiki] (https://github.com/bluestreak01/nfsdb/wiki)

NFSdb project is being actively supported and there will be more examples available in the next couple of days.
